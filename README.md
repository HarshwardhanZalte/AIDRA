# 🚨 AI Disaster Response Assistant (AIDRA)

AIDRA is an AI-powered emergency response and disaster assistant.

Users can upload an image of a disaster or accident (fire, flood, road accident, etc.). A multi-agent system, powered by Google Gemini, analyzes the image and provides a complete, actionable report including the disaster type, safety measures, step-by-step emergency actions, and localized authority contact numbers.
